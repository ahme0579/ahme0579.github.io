            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
            My name is Aashif, I am 21 years old born on the 26<sup>th</sup> of January 2002 and I am an international student from Sri Lanka at Algoqnuin College, I am currently enrolled in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I have only been in Canada for about a month but I am very much <em>in love</em> with the environment and the poeple here. Prior to my enrollment in the college, I was interning as a graphic designer, who then later carried over to work as a full-time freelance artist/graphic designer. One of my main primary interests/passions is Art, which is why I decided to take on this program to help build my brand and surround myself with other people who inspire/encourage me to continue my work.
            </p>

            <p>
            I would like to pursue a career in the field and hopefully land a high paying job as time allows and as mentioned prior continue to develop my brand and maybe even begin a startup business around my artwork. Growing up art has always been smething more than just a hobby, and to be able to carry this passion forward into my career drives me to work hard on this program, regardless of the difficulties it poses.
